  Hi everyone, I'm Liz's sister Alison and mawriage is what bwings us here towgether todaay. I just divided the room with that reference, sorry about that. 
  But it's true; we're here to celebrate two awesome people and their commitment to each other. <br>
  To say that my sister is an amazingly caring person is an understatement. I know I'm biased because she's my sister and best friend, but it's true. 
  She has always been there for me, doing all those things big sisters are supposed to do. Like holding me close when we cry a little too hard after
  a way too intense game of Barbies to letting me watch R rated movies wayyy before Mom and Dad said it was okay. I'm really lucky to have her as my sister. <br>
  I've been honored to see this love story unfold from day one. Liz and Damon are a perfect pair. They are the power couple of board games. 
  I'm so glad that my sister found someone who can explain board game rules way better than she can. But I'm also so glad she found someone 
  who's just as cool as Damon. He is supportive, caring, and I'm just really lucky to have him as a brother now. <br>
  May the two of you have nothing but sunshine and happiness every day in your marriage, but if the sky gets stormy may you find the strength in each other to weather the storm. <br>
  I love the both of you. I love the both of you together. I love how the both of you love each other. And I can't wait to be there to watch 
  and support the journey you two are going to continue to take together. To Liz and Damon! </p>
