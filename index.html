 <p><p style= "background-color:#053D84 ; border:10px solid #FFD44C ; font-family:cursive; text-align:left; font-size: 14pt;">My name is Ray Siedt and I'm Liz's father. It's wonderful to see all of you here for Liz and Damon's special day.<br><br>

Liz, your mom and I have always been proud of you in all things you do. You are a strong intelligent, beautiful woman, and from a very young age you knew what you wanted out of life and you perused it with all your energy and we watched with pride and support while you walked that path.<br><br>
Which brings us to this day. As your father, I always thought that there would never be anyone good enough for you to marry, and then you met Damon and I knew I was wrong. <br><br>
Damon you a great guy with a great family, and Lisa and I are so very happy that our family has grown to include you and your family.<br><br>
Lisa and I love you both and wish nothing but love and happiness for the rest of your lives together. May you have all you need and want for nothing, you can handle all things that come your way when two stand as one.<br><br>
All our love. <br><br></p>

 <p><p style= "background-color:#053D84; border:10px solid #FFD44C; font-family:cursive; text-align:left; font-size: 14pt;">Hi everyone, I'm Liz's sister Alison and mawriage is what bwings us here towgether todaay. I just divided the room with that reference, sorry about that. 
  But it's true; we're here to celebrate two awesome people and their commitment to each other. <br> <br>
  To say that my sister is an amazingly caring person is an understatement. I know I'm biased because she's my sister and best friend, but it's true. 
  She has always been there for me, doing all those things big sisters are supposed to do. Like holding me close when we cry a little too hard after
  a way too intense game of Barbies to letting me watch R rated movies wayyy before Mom and Dad said it was okay. I'm really lucky to have her as my sister. <br><br>
  I've been honored to see this love story unfold from day one. Liz and Damon are a perfect pair. They are the power couple of board games. 
  I'm so glad that my sister found someone who can explain board game rules way better than she can. But I'm also so glad she found someone 
  who's just as cool as Damon. He is supportive, caring, and I'm just really lucky to have him as a brother now. <br><br>
  May the two of you have nothing but sunshine and happiness every day in your marriage, but if the sky gets stormy may you find the strength in each other to weather the storm. <br><br>
  I love the both of you. I love the both of you together. I love how the both of you love each other. And I can't wait to be there to watch 
  and support the journey you two are going to continue to take together. To Liz and Damon! </p>
