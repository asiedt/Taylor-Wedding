 <p><p style= "background-color:#053D84 ; border:10px solid #FFD44C ; font-family:cursive; text-align:left; font-size: 14pt;">My name is Ray Siedt and I'm Liz's father. It's wonderful to see all of you here for Liz and Damon's special day.<br><br>

Liz, your mom and I have always been proud of you in all things you do. You are a strong intelligent, beautiful woman, and from a very young age you knew what you wanted out of life and you perused it with all your energy and we watched with pride and support while you walked that path.<br><br>
Which brings us to this day. As your father, I always thought that there would never be anyone good enough for you to marry, and then you met Damon and I knew I was wrong. <br><br>
Damon you a great guy with a great family, and Lisa and I are so very happy that our family has grown to include you and your family.<br><br>
Lisa and I love you both and wish nothing but love and happiness for the rest of your lives together. May you have all you need and want for nothing, you can handle all things that come your way when two stand as one.<br><br>
All our love. <br><br></p>

 <p> <p style="background-color:#053D84; border:10px solid #FFD44C; font-family:cursive; text-align:left; font-size: 18pt;"> A Speech to the Bride and Groom from the Best Man </p>
 <p> <p style= "background-color:#053D84; border:10px solid #FFD44C; font-family:cursive; text-align:left; font-size: 14pt;">For those who don’t know me, my name is Zach and I am probably Damon’s oldest, best, friend from the northwestern part of Fulton County Illinois. And that’s at least 500 people I was competing with. <br><br>
 Damon and I have known each other since we were 4, been friends since junior high, and somewhere between Mrs. Wasson’s art classes in high school and rooming together in college, he became one of the few people that I consider as close as any family I have. <br><br>
 There are so many things I could talk about in this toast but for the sake of time, I’m going to limit myself to a few highlights. First, I feel I have to mention that I owe a great debt to the late great Nathan Carroll. If Nate had not been both your friend and my friend, and had we not all hung out together, I believe I may have missed out on a great friend in you. And I know that Nate would have been thrilled to see you so happy. <br><br>
 Second, I saved Damon’s life once. Practically. It was after college, Damon was pursuing his art career and living in Arizona and several of us went out to see him for an extended weekend. While we were out there we decided to go hiking at a place called Bell Rock. It wasn’t an extremely difficult climb, we didn’t need any gear or anything; we just had to be careful on our way up. Going down was where it became tricky. The side we were going down was steep enough that we had to scoot down it while sitting; if we had tried to stand up and walk we would have fallen down. Trust me, it was tougher than it sounds. While we were making our way down each of us nearly slipped, which would have likely led to a very painful bouncy fall. Noticing this, I pointed out to our group that we could very well find out what type of friend each of us was because if the person above fell, the person below would have to make a split second decision, you know “fight or flight”, try to stop your friend from falling and likely fall yourself, or get out of the way, save yourself, and wish him luck the whole way down. As I said, each of us nearly slipped but Damon actually fell, which is to say that he didn’t stop slipping and began to accelerate uncontrolled down the side. I was directly below him and I chose, selflessly, and at great personal risk, to stay and try to catch him. For the sake of telling the truth I should mention that he did skid to a halt before reaching me and never actually fell into my recusing arms. But I think it is a better story when I describe it as me saving him, so we’ll go with that. The point is I’m a good friend. I would have bounced down the mountain with you, bud.  There are a bunch of other stories from our college days that I could get into but I won’t because they are all boring as all we ever had time to do was study for our classes. <br><br>
 The third thing I feel I have to mention is art as it played a large role in our friendship and a larger role in your life. We spent hours in art classes together and through those classes we became comfortable with critique. Both giving critique of each other’s work and receiving critical feedback as a means to improve ourselves. Those art classes together is where our friendship really grew and I think you would probably agree. Actually, I like to think that a large portion of your talent and success can be attributed to my words of critique and advice in those classes. So, for that, you’re welcome, I’m happy to have helped. <br><br>
 But while I have saved your life and helped mold you into the artist you have become, I can take not credit for your greatest accomplishment to date, finding Liz. <br><br>
 Liz, you are one of the most talented, funny, kind, best people I’ve ever known. I knew Damon was excited about you when he told us you would be coming to New Year’s at Dan, Megan, and AJ’s apartment. We can be an intimidating bunch to meet all at once as we tend to be somewhat loud and somewhat forward, and… let’s just say, even more so on New Year’s Eve… But you passed the friend test with flying colors. I remember telling Damon that I liked you a lot and he wasn’t surprised in the least. If his excitement was obvious before, it became obvious then but to be honest the huge grin on his face kind of gave it away. Sarah and I started crossing our fingers that he would have the good sense not to let you get away. And clearly he succeeded. <br><br>
 The two of you are truly two of the best people I’ll ever know and I know it’s a cliché but I can’t imagine either of you ever finding a better match anywhere in the world than what you have found in each other.  I can’t wait to see the wonderful things life has in store for the two of you and If I’m lucky, I hope to be a part of a few of them. So with that, I’d like to say, congratulations. To the happy couple. <br><br>  </p>

 <p><p style= "background-color:#053D84; border:10px solid #FFD44C; font-family:cursive; text-align:left; font-size: 14pt;">Hi everyone, I'm Liz's sister Alison and mawriage is what bwings us here towgether todaay. I just divided the room with that reference, sorry about that. 
  But it's true; we're here to celebrate two awesome people and their commitment to each other. <br> <br>
  To say that my sister is an amazingly caring person is an understatement. I know I'm biased because she's my sister and best friend, but it's true. 
  She has always been there for me, doing all those things big sisters are supposed to do. Like holding me close when we cry a little too hard after
  a way too intense game of Barbies to letting me watch R rated movies wayyy before Mom and Dad said it was okay. I'm really lucky to have her as my sister. <br><br>
  I've been honored to see this love story unfold from day one. Liz and Damon are a perfect pair. They are the power couple of board games. 
  I'm so glad that my sister found someone who can explain board game rules way better than she can. But I'm also so glad she found someone 
  who's just as cool as Damon. He is supportive, caring, and I'm just really lucky to have him as a brother now. <br><br>
  May the two of you have nothing but sunshine and happiness every day in your marriage, but if the sky gets stormy may you find the strength in each other to weather the storm. <br><br>
  I love the both of you. I love the both of you together. I love how the both of you love each other. And I can't wait to be there to watch 
  and support the journey you two are going to continue to take together. To Liz and Damon! </p>
